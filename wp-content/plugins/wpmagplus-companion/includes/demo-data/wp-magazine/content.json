first time the rappers have collaborated. And, in true Cardi fashion, the announced included great visuals, with a single cover of Cardi and Megan donning BAP-style updos with gold nameplate hoops that read WAP. Last night, Cardi and Meghan finally dropped a full music video for the single with a plethora of fashion and beauty looks that we'll be talking about forever.\n\nCardi\u2019s stylist Kollin Carter and Megan\u2019s stylist EJ King worked together to bring this vision to life from custom Mugler looks to zebra print bodysuits. While Tokyo Stylez and Kellon Deryck created all of the extravagant hairstyles. The theme was definitely camp, from the updo hairstyles and excessive animal print to the latex, with an obvious homage to rappers like Lil Kim and stylist Misa Hylton. Then there were the cameos from celebrities like Kylie Jenner, Normani, and Rosalia. We've already watched the \u201cWAP\u201d video at least 10 times, here are our favorite looks.\n<h3>Matching Neon Bodysuits and BAPS Updos<\/h3>\nAt Clarke\u2019s On the Table, Workshops with a Purpose and virtual Bree Blooms workshops, participants are provided flowers and vases and to make arrangements. \u201cWe create a safe place for uncomfortable conversations about racism, diversity, equality and identity,\u201d Clarke said.\n\nThe Little House Project\u2019s Little House on Routh and Little House of Bishop Arts are small events spaces lovingly restored by the Clarkes. \u201cWe open in areas that are gentrified. We make sure there\u2019s a place for Blacks. The uptown location is predominantly white and the house used to be slave quarters,\u201d Clarke said of Routh. \u201cI thought it would be cool to take something that had so much pain and bring some light to it.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, it\u2019s okay to, say, \u2018racism\u2019 and \u2018race.\u2019 Diversity and inclusion are the safe words,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cMy workshops launched nationally.

Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, each against all with one winner.\n\nSports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.","post_excerpt":"\n\t\t\t\tA number of such two-sided contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion.
